- Brief overview about the business problem, the dataset and the tools used.
- The resulting models (lr, dc, rf) and their final accuracies.
- Now begins the analysis itself. The first section should be the explanation of each column and the data type (str function).
- After knowing the dataset, it is time to clean it up, beginning with NA values and see which column will be removed or not.
- Now, the longest section is this one, that is EDA. Need to analyze each column individually, maybe subsections here could help.
- This one should show the chi-squared test and its results. Discuss about previous conclusions and the chi2 test.
- Now is the time to build models, beginning with logistic regression, then decision tree, then random forest.
- After evaluating these 3 models, check the importance of variables and train again, take conclusions and pick the best models.
- Final conclusion of the analysis.
